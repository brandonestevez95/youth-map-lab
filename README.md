# 🌍 Youth Mapping Lab
**AI + GIS Workshops for Curious Minds & Change-Makers**

Welcome to the **Youth Mapping Lab** — where students explore the world, solve real problems, and tell powerful stories using artificial intelligence, satellite data, and GIS technology.

Developed by youth, for youth, this open-source initiative blends cutting-edge geospatial tools with real-world challenges — from farming to forgotten history — to empower the next generation of digital explorers.

---

## 🚀 What Students Will Do
- 🧠 **Think like scientists** — ask big questions and solve real-world problems using data and maps.
- 🛰️ **Use real tools** — get hands-on with AI, ArcGIS, Google Earth, satellite imagery, and more.
- 🗺️ **Make cool stuff** — design a smart farm or build a “time machine” map of community change.
- 💬 **Tell their story** — present findings like civic tech leaders, scientists, or historians.

## 🌟 Workshop Modules

### 🛰️ Satellites to Seeds
Students step into the role of agri-scientists using real data to design climate-smart farms.
- 📍 Map ideal growing zones with GIS and climate overlays
- 🤖 Simulate AI-powered plant ID with Teachable Machine
- 💧 Evaluate environmental risks like droughts and floods
- 🌾 Build a future farm map (digital or printable)

### 🕰 Build a Time Machine with AI & GIS
Students become urban historians, mapping how local communities have changed over time.
- 🧭 Compare historic vs. modern maps (StoryMap, swipe, or print)
- 📸 Use AI tools to decode newspaper articles or handwritten records
- 🗺 Create a "Then–Now–Future" map project
- 🏙 Explore themes of justice, memory, and neighborhood change

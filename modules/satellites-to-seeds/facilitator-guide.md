## 📅 Workshop Agenda

### 1. 🌾 Welcome & Warm-Up (5 min)
- Ask: “Where does your food come from?”
- Kick off with a map or emoji poll on crop origins
- Set the tone: “You’ll plan a farm using real tools like scientists.”

---

### 2. 🤖 AI in Agriculture (10 min)
- What is AI? Quick primer
- Show: [Google Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) with plant classifier
- Discuss:
  - How AI can help monitor farms (e.g. crop health)
  - Where do *humans* still need to be in control?

---

## 3. 🛰 GIS Activities (45 min)

### 🧠 Farming Basics (5 min)
- Discuss: Sunlight, soil, water, risk zones
- Role of GIS in modern agriculture

---

### 🗺️ Mapping Climate & Soil Zones (5 min)
- Show students the AGOL map and its layers:
  - What do climate and soil tell us?
  - Which areas are best for blueberries? For sweet potatoes?

---

### 📍 Activity – Map the Future Farm (15 min)
- Objective: Choose 1 of 3 crops and plan where to plant it
- Students:
  - Analyze NC’s soil & climate layers
  - Pin (digital) or circle (paper) their ideal farm site
  - Justify why it fits their chosen crop

📎 Use: [`SatellitesToSeeds–StudentWorksheet.pdf`](./SatellitesToSeeds–StudentWorksheet.pdf)  
🗺 Paper or digital depending on setting

---

### 🌪️ Risk Mapping & Resilience (5 min)
- Add overlays: Drought zones, hurricanes, floodplains
- Ask: “What risks do you see near your farm?”

---

### 🚨 Activity – Disaster Strikes! (10 min)
- Hand out disaster cards or use a random generator
- Students re-map or adjust farms
- Write down:
  - What changed?
  - What protection measures did you add?

---

### 🤖 Bonus: Teachable Machine Demo (5 min)
- Classify “healthy vs. sick” crops with webcam
- Reflect: “Would you trust this to decide when to water?”

---

## 🧑‍🔬 Careers in AgTech (5 min)
Highlight key STEM careers:
- Agronomist
- GIS Analyst
- Climate Scientist
- AgTech Developer
- Sustainability Officer

---

## 📣 Wrap-Up & Recruitment (10 min)
- Students share maps → Farm Gallery Walk
- Optional: Vote on “Most Resilient” or “Most Creative” design
- Invite to join:
  - Wake 4-H GIS Team
  - SparkNC AI Badges
  - National 4-H Geospatial Team

---

## ✅ Facilitator Tips
- Bring a printed large map of NC for group demo
- Plan both high-tech and lo-fi versions
- Prepare “extensions” for fast finishers (map puzzles, crop trivia)
- Encourage teamwork + creative justification

---

## 🧠 Assessment Rubric
| Criteria                         | 1 pt  | 2 pts | 3 pts |
|----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Farm location choice             | Weak  | Logical | Optimal |
| Used GIS layers to adapt plan    | Minimal | Partial | Strong evidence |
| Explanation & justification      | Vague | Clear | Insightful |

## 📝 Paper-Based Workshop Option

This module works great in classrooms or clubs with no digital access. You can run *Satellites to Seeds* using only printed materials, markers, and a whiteboard — while keeping all key learning outcomes.

[Tip!] A great introduction StoryMap is linked here: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/92e0255b4a484c9db8ef5ca0021f79d5

### 🧾 What to Prepare

| Resource         | Prep Tip |
|------------------|----------|
| **Maps**         | Screenshot your AGOL map with layers ON (climate, soil, risk), then print 1–3 versions on 8.5x11 or 11x17 paper. Laminate if possible for dry-erase reuse. |
| **Student Worksheet** | Use the PDF as-is or simplify it with boxes and icons for younger students. |
| **Crop Cards**   | Print the [CropParameterCards.docx](./CropParameterCards.docx) and cut them into cards. Add emoji icons to simplify for Grades 5–6. |
| **Disaster Cards** | Use the [Canva Disaster Cards](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGnGNAFvbs/3fPB0pZk5TNXZRWa-5o8-Q/edit) as a physical draw deck. Each group draws one mid-way through the activity. |
| **Stickers or Markers** | Let students "pin" their farms with dot stickers or Sharpie circles. |

### 🧭 Suggested Station Setup (Optional)

Divide the class into 4 teams and rotate through:

1. **Map the Future Farm** – Choose location using printed maps
2. **Disaster Strikes!** – Draw a card, update farm plan
3. **Crop Match** – Match crop cards to best zones
4. **Gallery & Jobs** – Share ideas, vote, and discuss ag careers

Each station runs ~10–15 minutes. No tech needed, just printables and a few classroom supplies.

### 💡 Tips

- Use a whiteboard to draw a basic NC map (coastal, piedmont, mountains) if you can’t print.
- Add stickers or cutouts (🌱 🌀 ☀️) to represent weather, risk, and soil conditions.
- Encourage students to justify decisions with visual symbols and short phrases.

# Facilitator Guide: Satellites to Seeds Workshop

## Overview
This hands-on workshop introduces students to the intersection of agriculture, climate science, and artificial intelligence. Participants explore how satellite data and GIS tools help plan smart farms that are resilient to environmental risks.

**Target Audience**: Grades 5–9  
**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Themes**: Environmental Science, Agriculture, GIS, AI  
**Delivery Format**: Paper or digital

## 🧰 Pre-Workshop Setup

### Digital Prep
- ✅ Ensure access to ArcGIS Online or Felt
- ✅ Load the *SatellitesToSeeds* AGOL map with:
  - USDA Plant Hardiness Zones
  - World Soils (Organic Carbon Density)
  - North American Precipitation (NA Atlas)
  - FEMA Flood Zones
  - NOAA Drought Intensity
  - Recent Hurricanes/Typhoons (NOAA)
- ✅ Test StoryMap or Instant App functionality

### Materials Checklist
- Paper maps with climate + soil zones
- Disaster Cards (printed)
- Stickers/markers (for crop placement)
- Student Worksheet
- AV setup (projector/screen for map demo)

## 📅 Workshop Timeline

### 1. Welcome & Warm-Up (5 min)
- Ask: “Where does your food come from?”
- Use interactive poll or emoji map
- Transition: “What if you had to grow it yourself?”

### 2. AI in Agriculture (10 min)
- Mini-lesson: What is AI? When is it helpful vs. risky?
- Demo: Google Teachable Machine (plant classification)
- Prompt: “Would you trust AI to run your farm?”

---

## 3. GIS Activities (45 min)

### 🧠 Real-World Farming 101 (5 min)
- Brief intro to plant needs (soil, sun, water)
- Explain GIS maps as farmer decision tools

### 🗺️ Climate & Soil Mapping Demo (5 min)
- Use AGOL map or large paper printout
- Show how zones affect crop choices

### 📍 Activity – Map the Future Farm (10–15 min)
- **Goal**: Choose the best NC location to grow one crop
- Use paper maps or AGOL/Felt map
- Reference a crop info sheet or legend
- Students:
  - Circle/mark ideal zones
  - Write short justification: “Why here?”
  - Add to large class map (if available)

### 🌪️ Environmental Risk Mini-Lesson (5 min)
- Display risk layers (flood, drought, hurricanes)
- Ask: “Which areas are most dangerous for crops?”

### 🚨 Activity – Disaster Strikes! (10 min)
- Students receive a random Disaster Card
- Re-map or adapt their farm:
  - Move it?
  - Add mitigation features (windbreak, drainage)?
- Write/Draw: “What did we do to protect our crops?”

---

## 🌱 Careers in Smart Agriculture (5 min)
- Present 3–5 future career paths:
  - AgTech Developer
  - GIS Analyst
  - Environmental Planner
  - Drone Technician
  - Agronomist
- Use a visual slide or local scientist video

---

## 📣 Wrap-Up & Recruitment (10 min)
- Students share their final farms
- Ask: “What did you learn from building your farm?”
- Invite students to:
  - Join Wake 4-H GIS
  - Explore SparkNC AI badges
  - Sign up for the National Team mailing list

---

## ✅ Tips for Success
- Over-plan: some students work fast!
- Encourage drawing/collaboration
- Use local crops if possible (sweet potatoes, berries)
- Make it a game: which farm survives best?
